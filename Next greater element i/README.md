# 496. Next greater element i

## Problem
The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.

You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.

For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.

Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000
0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 104
All integers in nums1 and nums2 are unique.
All the integers of nums1 also appear in nums2.

## Approach
1. Create an empty list to track the list of first_greater items.
2. Go through each item in nums1.
3. Find the position that item is in nums2.
4. Then we go through each item to the right of that item and if that value is greater than the value of the item. We add this to the next_greater_list. We then break the loop so it only considers the first value that is greater and not all values.
5. If we get to the last value in the list and there is no value greater than the value we are on, then we add -1 to the list to indicate there are no values.
6. We then return the list.
